## 🧪 Testing RAG Features

After loading this data, test these scenarios:

### 1. Context Panel Test
Open the conversation and check the **Context** panel (green):
- Should show conversation summary
- Should identify safe topics (Flutter, animations, work-life balance)
- Should note the working relationship quality
- Should update as you add new messages

### 2. Action Items Test
Check the **Actions** panel (orange):
- Should extract multiple action items from compound messages
- Examples: messages #3, #12, #26, #37
- Should categorize action types

### 3. Boundary Detection Test
Analyze these messages for boundary violations:
- **Message #5**: Late evening (10 PM) work request
- **Message #32**: Sunday urgent request
- Should detect time-based boundary violations

### 4. RSD Detection Test
Analyze the sequence around messages #17-20:
- Message #17 could trigger RSD (implied criticism)
- Should show alternative interpretations
- Should note the immediate reassurance pattern
