  Realtime Message Diagnostic Test
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  This test will help you diagnose why messages aren't being received.
  
  Current Issues Detected:
  - Realtime subscription connects then immediately closes (CLOSED status)
  
  Possible Causes:
  
  1. ❌ You're navigating away from the message screen
     → The widget dispose() method calls unsubscribe
     → This closes the connection
     → Solution: Stay on the message screen!
  
  2. ❌ Supabase Realtime not enabled for messages table
     → Go to: Supabase Dashboard → Database → Replication
     → Enable INSERT for the messages table
     → Solution: Enable replication
  
  3. ❌ Network issues in emulator
     → Check emulator network connectivity
     → Solution: Restart emulator or check settings
  
  4. ❌ Both emulators not in the same conversation
     → Realtime only works within the same conversation
     → Solution: Make sure both users open the SAME conversation
  
  5. ❌ Widget hot reload causing reconnection
     → Hot reload disposes the widget
     → Solution: Do a full restart instead

  Testing Checklist
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  On Emulator A (Receiver):
  [ ] Open the app
  [ ] Sign in as User A
  [ ] Navigate to a conversation
  [ ] STAY on the message screen (don't navigate away!)
  [ ] Watch the logs
  [ ] You should see: "✅ Successfully subscribed to messages"
  [ ] You should NOT see: "CLOSED" immediately after
  
  On Emulator B (Sender):
  [ ] Open the app  
  [ ] Sign in as User B
  [ ] Navigate to the SAME conversation
  [ ] Send a message
  [ ] Watch Emulator A's logs
  
  Expected Result on Emulator A:
  ✅ "📥 New message received from realtime!"
  ✅ "📥 Payload: {...}"
  ✅ Message appears in the UI
  
  If You Don't See This:
  1. Check Supabase Dashboard → Tables → messages
     - Was the message inserted?
     - If NO: Problem with message sending
     - If YES: Problem with realtime subscription
  
  2. Check Supabase Dashboard → Database → Replication
     - Is messages table enabled for replication?
     - Is INSERT event enabled?
     - If NO: Enable it!
  
  3. Check both emulator logs for:
     - "❌ Connection CLOSED" → Widget was disposed
     - "❌ CHANNEL_ERROR" → Replication not enabled
     - "⏰ TIMED_OUT" → Network issues
