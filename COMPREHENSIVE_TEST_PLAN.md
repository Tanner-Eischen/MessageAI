# Comprehensive Test Plan - All 4 Phases

## Testing Status Overview

### ✅ Phase 4: Smart Follow-up System
**Status:** Fully testable - Models complete, services implemented

**Unit Tests Completed:**
- ✅ `follow_up_item_test.dart` - 15 tests PASSED
- ✅ `action_item_test.dart` - 12 tests PASSED

**Total:** 27/27 tests passing ✅

### ⚠️ Phase 1-3: Integration Tests Need Service Implementation

The integration test files reveal several services that need to be created or have different APIs than expected:

**Phase 1 Missing/Incomplete:**
- `ToneAnalysisService` (exists but API may differ)
- `MessageInterpreterService` (may not exist)

**Phase 2 Missing/Incomplete:**
- `DraftConfidenceService` (exists but API may differ)
- `MessageFormatterService` formatting methods

**Phase 3 Missing/Incomplete:**
- `RelationshipSummaryService` (needs creation)
- `ContextPreloaderService` methods need implementation

## Recommended Testing Approach

### Step 1: Test What Exists ✅
```bash
# Phase 4 Models (DONE)
flutter test test/models/follow_up_item_test.dart
flutter test test/models/action_item_test.dart
```

### Step 2: Create Simple Service Tests
Let me create testable service wrappers...

---

## Test Categories

### 1. Model Tests (Unit Tests)
Test data structures and business logic

**Phase 4:**
- ✅ FollowUpItem
- ✅ ActionItem  
- ✅ ContextTrigger (model exists)

### 2. Service Tests (Unit Tests with Mocks)
Test service logic without external dependencies

**Phase 4:**
- FollowUpService (needs mocking)

### 3. Widget Tests
Test UI components

**Phase 4:**
- FollowUpDashboardScreen
- FollowUpCard
- ActionItemBadge

### 4. Integration Tests
Test full flows with real backend

**All Phases:**
- Requires deployed backend
- Requires test data setup
- Best done in staging environment

## Quick Win: Test Models

Let me run tests on all existing models right now...
