# Phase 1: Core Real-time Functionality - COMPLETE

## Summary

Phase 1 has been successfully completed. All real-time features have been implemented and tested.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Proper Supabase Realtime Subscriptions
**Status**: Already implemented (no polling found)
- Real-time message synchronization using `RealtimeListenTypes.postgresChanges`
- Proper channel management with subscription/unsubscription
- Broadcast channels for typing indicators

**Files**:
- `frontend/lib/services/realtime_message_service.dart`
- `frontend/lib/services/typing_indicator_service.dart`

### 2. ✅ Real-time Presence Tracking
**Status**: Enhanced
- Added proper presence state change listeners
- Implemented `onPresenceSync`, `onPresenceJoin`, `onPresenceLeave` callbacks
- Stream-based presence updates
- Per-conversation online user tracking

**Files**:
- `frontend/lib/services/presence_service.dart`

### 3. ✅ Typing Indicator Real-time Streams
**Status**: Working correctly
- Broadcast-based typing indicators
- 3-second timeout for inactive typing
- Per-conversation typing user tracking
- Proper cleanup on unsubscribe

**Files**:
- `frontend/lib/services/typing_indicator_service.dart`

### 4. ✅ Connection Status Indicator
**Status**: Implemented
- Visual indicator at top of screens
- Color-coded status (green/orange/amber/red)
- Status states: connected, connecting, reconnecting, disconnected
- Manual retry button when disconnected
- Stream-based status updates

**Files**:
- `frontend/lib/services/connection_service.dart`
- `frontend/lib/features/common/widgets/connection_status_indicator.dart`
- Updated: `frontend/lib/features/conversations/screens/conversations_list_screen.dart`
- Updated: `frontend/lib/features/messages/screens/message_screen.dart`

### 5. ✅ Reconnection Logic with Exponential Backoff
**Status**: Implemented
- Exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s → 60s (max)
- Maximum 10 reconnection attempts
- Automatic retry on connection loss
- Manual force reconnect available
- Proper state management during reconnection

**Files**:
- `frontend/lib/services/connection_service.dart`

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (4 files)
1. **ConnectionService Tests** (`test/services/connection_service_test.dart`)
   - Initial status verification
   - Status stream emission
   - Exponential backoff calculation
   - Max backoff cap at 60 seconds
   - Force reconnect functionality
   - Stream disposal

2. **PresenceService Tests** (`test/services/presence_service_test.dart`)
   - Singleton pattern verification
   - Online users tracking
   - User online status checks
   - Stream subscription management
   - Resource cleanup

3. **TypingIndicatorService Tests** (`test/services/typing_indicator_service_test.dart`)
   - Singleton pattern verification
   - Typing users tracking
   - 3-second typing timeout verification
   - Stream subscription management
   - Resource cleanup

4. **RealTimeMessageService Tests** (`test/services/realtime_message_service_test.dart`)
   - Singleton pattern verification
   - Message stream subscriptions
   - Multiple conversation handling
   - Resource cleanup

### Integration Tests (2 files)
1. **Real-time Message Flow Tests** (`test/integration/realtime_message_flow_test.dart`)
   - Message subscription delivery
   - Multiple subscription handling
   - Unsubscribe behavior
   - Error handling
   - Multiple listener support

2. **Presence & Typing Integration Tests** (`test/integration/presence_typing_integration_test.dart`)
   - Independent service operation
   - Separate state management
   - Multiple conversation handling
   - Cross-service non-interference
   - Concurrent operations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Connection Status States
```dart
enum ConnectionStatus {
  connected,     // Normal operation (indicator hidden)
  connecting,    // Initial connection (orange)
  disconnected,  // Connection lost (red with retry button)
  reconnecting,  // Attempting reconnect (amber with spinner)
}
```

### Exponential Backoff Algorithm
```
Attempt 1: 1 second
Attempt 2: 2 seconds
Attempt 3: 4 seconds
Attempt 4: 8 seconds
Attempt 5: 16 seconds
Attempt 6: 32 seconds
Attempt 7: 60 seconds (capped)
...
Attempt 10: 60 seconds (max attempts reached)
```

### Presence Event Handling
```dart
channel.onPresenceSync(() => updateUsers())
channel.onPresenceJoin((payload) => handleJoin(payload))
channel.onPresenceLeave((payload) => handleLeave(payload))
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cd frontend
flutter test

# Run specific test suite
flutter test test/services/
flutter test test/integration/

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

## Dependencies Added

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  mockito: ^5.4.4
  fake_async: ^1.3.1
```

## UI Changes

1. **Conversations List Screen**
   - Added `ConnectionStatusIndicator` at the top
   - Shows connection status banner when not connected

2. **Message Screen**
   - Added `ConnectionStatusIndicator` at the top
   - Shows connection status banner when not connected
